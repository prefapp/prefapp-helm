## Documentation guide
This documentation branch holds the project's documentation source code.

Here are some basic notions to help a new contributor set up and enhance the documentation stored in this branch:

- The documentation is generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and published via Github pages. 

- The source code is stored here in the `documentation` branch while the static files served via Pages are located in the `gh-pages` branch (please dont go and touch there).
